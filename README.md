# Project Movie_Website

Python code for to store movie information in a class called Movie and display a responsive Website with the favourite movies using HRTML and CSS.

## Getting Started

I used Python 2.7.13 as stated in the Shebang lines.

You need to download and rund Python 2.7.13 to run the program.
You can download it here: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2713/

You will need the files 'entertainment_center.py', 'media.py' and 'fresh_tomatoes.py' stored in one directory.

Run the file 'entertainment_center.py' and the Website will open.

To do so, compile the 'entertainment_center.py' file in a text editor (e.g. atom) or, using a command line tool, just do the following:

-- navigate to the subdiretory where the above mentioned files are located (use command like 'cd' and 'ls' to move to the directory and explore the files).

-- run the code with the command 'python entertainment_center.py' and the Website will open.

## Coding style test

I used the PEP8 online check (http://pep8online.com/) to check the Python code for PEP8 style requirements - it display some warnings because of the length of the URLs - I decided to keep the URLs together and not break the lines for easier reading - commented with #NOQA.
